  <h1>What Makes Up a Web Page?</h1>
  	<p>When you view a Web page in your browser, you only see text, graphics, and images. Once in a while, you hear sounds, and you see animation. Behind the scenes, it's HTML tags that make it all work and properly display these items in your browser. Some of the things that HTML tags do are:
  		<ul>
  			<li>Format headings and paragraph styles</li>
  			<li>Create bulleted and number lists</li>
  			<li>Insert images, Java applets, Active X components, and a lot of other cool stuff</li>
  			<li>Create links that take you to other pages</li>
  		</ul></p>
  	<p>Writing HTML code isn't as tough as you think! In spite of the many tools that are available, you can easily write Web pages with a simple text editor.</p>
